There are many different traditional calendar systems in use in India mainly for religious purposes.  The goal of this project is to implement as many of them as possible as open source so it becomes possible to use Indian dates in as many places as possible.  The initial language of implementation will be perl using the DateTime API but hopefully other languages/APIs will also be supported.
