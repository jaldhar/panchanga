DateTime-Indic

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README
file from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive
can use it to get an idea of the module's uses. It is usually a good idea
to provide version information here so that people can decide whether
fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION

If you have the Module::Signature module installed, you can verify the
integrity of this distribution by typing:

    cpansign -v

Module::Signature requires GnuPG which you can get from: 
http://www.gnupg.org/download/
A binary version for Windows is available from that page.
        
Then to install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.pl
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install
    
On Windows you don't need to type the preliminary ./

Alternatively, you can do:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you are using ActiveState perl on Windows and you don't have a make 
utility, you can download nmake from:
http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/patch/1.52/w95/en-us/nmake15.exe
(Replace make with nmake in the instructions above if you are using it.)

If you are using Strawberry perl on Windows, it comes with a make utility 
called dmake.  (Replace make with dmake in the instructions above if you are
using it.)

Using this module requires these distributions:

DateTime
DateTime-Event-Lunar (0.06 or above)
DateTime-Event-Sunrise
DateTime-Util-Calc (0.13 or above)
Params-Validate

At build time you will need these plus the following if you want to run all 
the tests

Module-Signature
Test-Pod (1.22 or above)
Test-Pod-Coverage (1.04 or above)
Test-Perl-Critic (This test will only run if the env var TEST_AUTHOR has a 
                  true value)

They are all available on CPAN (http://www.cpan.org)
